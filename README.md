# Detection-of-Cardiovascular-Disease-using-ECG-Images-wuth-deepLearning-Methods
# ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases) are the leading cause of death worldwide. The earlier they can be predicted and classified; the more lives can be saved. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common, inexpensive, and non-invasive tool for measuring the electrical activity of the heart and is used to detect cardiovascular disease. In this project, the power of deep learning techniques was used to predict the four major cardiac abnormalities: abnormal heartbeat, myocardial infarction, history of myocardial infarction, and normal person classes using the public ECG images dataset of cardiac patients.
The aim is to improve early detection and classification of cardiovascular diseases, which are a leading cause of death globally. The project proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for this purpose. The study compares the performance of the CNN model with existing works, getting superior results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Additionally, the CNN model is used for feature extraction in conjunction with traditional machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, K-nearest neighbours, and logistic regression, with promising outcomes.
Furthermore, utilization of XGBoost, an optimized distributed gradient boosting library, to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model. XGBoost is highlighted for its efficiency and scalability in training machine learning models, making it a valuable tool for ensemble learning and improving prediction accuracy.In this project, Streamlit, a popular open-source Python library for building interactive web applications, is integrated to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the predictive model.
